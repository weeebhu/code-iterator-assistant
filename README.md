# 🎮 Aicade Code Iterator AI

**Aicade Code Iterator AI** is a developer-friendly tool that uses an AI assistant to help you iteratively improve game-related code. With natural language instructions, you can generate suggestions, view diffs, and integrate improvements directly into your workflow—all within a Streamlit interface.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Paste your code into the editor  
- 💡 Enter a natural language instruction (e.g., "Add gravity to the player movement")  
- 🤖 AI-generated code suggestions using `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct`  
- 📋 Diff view to compare original vs. modified code  
- 🔍 Clear explanation of changes  
- 🧩 One-click integration of improvements into the original code  
- 🧠 View history of all past interactions

## 🚀 Live Demo

- https://code-iterator-assistant-iaj4rvsqmmmmkkgfwttmel.streamlit.app/

## 📦 Installation

- Clone the repository
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aicade-code-iterator.git
     cd aicade-code-iterator

- Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

- Setup secrets
    Create a .streamlit/secrets.toml file:
    OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openrouter-api-key"
    OPENAI_BASE_URL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"  # or your preferred base URL

- Run the app
    streamlit run app.py


## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user pastes code and enters a natural language instruction.
2. The modify_code() function sends this to the Mistral-7B model via OpenRouter.
3. The model returns:
4. A new version of the code
5. A human-readable explanation of the changes
6. A unified diff is computed and displayed.
7. Users can review and choose to integrate the modified code into their base.

## 🛠️ Todo / Future Work

- ✅ Final code integration (retains original code structure)
- 🌐 Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- 🧪 Add unit tests for diff & integration logic
- 🧵 Enable inline code commenting
- 💬 Add conversational memory with threading
